"""New:    1. A faster way to do functions

             2. New uses for functions -  Organize code,  Reuse Code, Improve Efficiency 

             3. Global variables. (all our variables  from before become local variables, and we bring in new global variables)

 

Specification:  User enters income.  Tax rate is 10% at or below 100,000 dollars, 15% otherwise.

Use two functions, one for tax rate and the other for tax, and display tax.

Extended Spec:  Modify the program to support multiple inputs, and compute the average tax across this series of inputs.

inputs: income (float)
outputs: tax (float)
