Python Coursework 

📘 Coursework Summary – IS 320 (Introduction to Programming with Python)
This collection of Python scripts demonstrates a comprehensive journey through core programming concepts, practical applications, and problem-solving techniques covered throughout the IS 320 course. Projects span from foundational input/output operations and control structures to more advanced topics like functions, object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and real-world simulations.

Key themes include:

User Interaction & Input Handling: Many files focus on gathering user input, performing calculations, and outputting results, helping build foundational fluency in scripting logic.
Control Flow & Loops: The assignments reinforce use of if/else statements, for and while loops to guide decision-making and iteration.
Functions & Modular Design: Several scripts practice defining reusable functions to organize logic cleanly and improve code readability.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): A number of assignments explore classes, objects, inheritance, and method definitions, showcasing the principles of encapsulation and reusability.
File I/O & Data Persistence: Programs such as the dictionary apps demonstrate how to read from and write to external files, introducing persistent data storage.
Applied Projects: Examples include simulated airline ticketing systems, debugging exercises, and small GUI apps, translating concepts into practical solutions.


🛫 Airline Ticketing Program
➤ I made a flight seat selector where the user chooses their ticket type, and the program calculates the final price with tax and outputs a receipt.

🍔 Restaurant Menu System
➤ I built an interactive food ordering system that lets the user pick menu items, calculates totals with discounts, and loops until the user exits.
File: App1(Reference HW6).py

📚 Dictionary Quiz Game
➤ I made a dictionary quiz that asks for vocabulary translations and provides real-time scoring.
File: DictApp1+DictApp2.py, DictIntro_Sub.py

🎓 Student Grade Tracker with OOP
➤ I created a student grade tracker where users input names and scores. The data is stored in a class and summarized.
File: oop1 + oop2.py, oopexample.py

🛠️ Variable Scope Debugger
➤ I created a demo that compares global and local variable behavior, prompting the user to guess outcomes.
File: debug_local_global.py

🎫 Seating Chart Program
➤ I coded a seat layout where the user picks a seat by entering row and column values. The program checks if it’s available.

🧮 Grade Averaging with Validation
➤ I made a calculator that takes a set of test scores from the user, validates input, and computes an average with letter grades.

📝 Form-Based Entry Application
➤ I designed a form where users enter personal information and get feedback based on their inputs.
