# IS320AppProgramming
Python Coursework 

📘 Coursework Summary – IS 320 (Introduction to Programming with Python)
This collection of Python scripts demonstrates a comprehensive journey through core programming concepts, practical applications, and problem-solving techniques covered throughout the IS 320 course. Projects span from foundational input/output operations and control structures to more advanced topics like functions, object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and real-world simulations.

Key themes include:

User Interaction & Input Handling: Many files focus on gathering user input, performing calculations, and outputting results, helping build foundational fluency in scripting logic.
Control Flow & Loops: The assignments reinforce use of if/else statements, for and while loops to guide decision-making and iteration.
Functions & Modular Design: Several scripts practice defining reusable functions to organize logic cleanly and improve code readability.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): A number of assignments explore classes, objects, inheritance, and method definitions, showcasing the principles of encapsulation and reusability.
File I/O & Data Persistence: Programs such as the dictionary apps demonstrate how to read from and write to external files, introducing persistent data storage.
Applied Projects: Examples include simulated airline ticketing systems, debugging exercises, and small GUI apps, translating concepts into practical solutions.


📚 Student Records Manager – A full-featured student tracking system using a list of dictionaries to input, validate, search (by name or ID), summarize, display, and save student records with structured logic and file persistence.

Files: App1(Reference HW6).py

📘 Student Records Manager (Dictionary-Based)
This script builds a comprehensive student record system using a global dictionary, enabling line-based input, robust validation, average and grade calculations, file I/O, and both ID and name-based search.

Files: DictApp1+DictApp2.py

🥕 Grocery Billing Calculator
This script calculates the final bill for a custom produce order (artichokes, carrots, beets) using conditional logic for tiered shipping and discounting high-value orders, reinforcing control flow, arithmetic, and user input handling.

Files: JCWanneHW2_1.py

🎓 Dual Grading Evaluator
This script processes student scores using two grading schemes (pass/fail and letter grades), updates category counts, and computes average scores for each type, offering flexibility and modular grade analysis with real-time user interaction.

Files: JWanneHW4_1.py

💰 Tax Bracket Calculator
This script calculates individual tax liabilities based on income, marital status, and exemptions while tracking high-bracket taxpayers and computing average taxes for summary reporting.

Files: JwanneHW4_2.py

📚 Book Order Tracker
Calculates total order cost for book purchases, applying shipping fees or sales tax depending on online/offline status, while tracking order types and computing average revenue per order.
Files: Lec9App1.py

💰 Tax Bracket Evaluator
Calculates tax based on marital status and income thresholds, then tracks and averages total tax and married taxpayer tax data for insightful summaries.

Files: MidtermPracP1.py

🧾 Input Validator
Validates name, income, and marital status inputs with nested try-except and assert blocks, ensuring robust data entry before proceeding with any processing.

Files: SS3.py

🧾 Taxpayer Management System
Stores, validates, and computes tax data for multiple users using a global dictionary keyed by taxpayer IDs. Includes tax calculation, data display, ID/status search, and statistical summaries.

Files: jwanneHW5.py

🗂️ Taxpayer Records Logger
Computes and logs individual tax records based on income and marital status into a structured list of dictionaries with searchable and savable features.

Files: jwanneHW6.py

📦 Order Tracker & Tax Reporter
Manages and validates international online/offline orders by country, computes tax with class-based encapsulation, and supports full reporting, searching, saving, and resetting workflows.

Files: jwanneHW7.py

💼 Taxpayer Class Manager
Object-oriented tax processing system using a Taxpayer class to calculate tax based on income and state rules, track high-income earners, and support reporting, searching, and saving—all while demonstrating encapsulation and static/class methods.

Files: oop1 + oop2.py

🐾 Pet Object Blueprint
Simple object-oriented model using a Pet class with instance attributes, methods like speak() and display(), and a class variable to track total pets—ideal for learning class structure and behavior in Python.

Files: oopexample.py
